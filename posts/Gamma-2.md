Via Ferrata Gamma 2 is a renowned and challenging route located on the steep slopes of Monte Resegone, near Lecco, in the Lombardy region of northern Italy. It is considered more demanding than its sibling, Via Ferrata Gamma 1, and is ideal for climbers with prior experience looking for a more technical and thrilling ascent.

The route is equipped with the familiar combination of metal rungs, cables, and iron ladders, but Gamma 2 ups the ante with more vertical and exposed sections. These features require climbers to engage in sustained climbing moves and manage some heart-pounding drops beneath their feet. However, the difficulty of the climb is rewarded by breathtaking views of Lake Como and the expansive Lecco valley below, providing a stunning backdrop as climbers progress through the route.

The ascent begins from the same Piani d'Erna cable car station that serves Gamma 1, but Gamma 2 takes climbers on a more intense vertical adventure. The route typically takes several hours to complete, depending on the climber’s skill and pace. It leads toward a high point on the Resegone ridge, which stands at 1,875 meters. Though not the tallest peak, the exposure and technical nature of the climb give it an adventurous edge.

As with any via ferrata, climbers need essential safety gear, including a helmet, harness, and via ferrata lanyard. Given the technical difficulty and the route’s exposure to the elements, it’s especially important to check weather conditions before starting, as rain or poor visibility can make the already demanding climb much more dangerous.

Via Ferrata Gamma 2 provides a thrilling challenge for climbers seeking a high-adrenaline experience, surrounded by stunning alpine scenery. For those ready to test their skills on one of the most demanding via ferrata routes in the Lecco region, Gamma 2 delivers an unforgettable adventure.
