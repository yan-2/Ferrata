Via Ferrata Gamma 1 is an iconic and well-loved climbing route located on Monte Resegone, near Lecco in northern Italy. Offering an exhilarating mix of technical climbs and sweeping views over Lake Como, this route is perfect for climbers who have experience with via ferrata or technical climbing, but it is also accessible to fit beginners looking for a challenge.

Gamma 1 is renowned for its thrilling combination of metal rungs, steel cables, and iron ladders fixed into the rock, allowing climbers to ascend the steep, exposed sections of the mountain face. The route follows a beautiful and varied path, providing a mix of demanding vertical climbs and moments of relief with more moderate sections. As climbers ascend, they are treated to breathtaking vistas of the Lecco valley, Lake Como, and the surrounding peaks of the Lombardy region.

Starting from the Piani d'Erna cable car station, the approach to Gamma 1 involves a short but scenic hike. The climb itself generally takes several hours to complete, with the summit offering a sense of great accomplishment and panoramic views that make the effort worthwhile. Monte Resegone's peak, at 1,875 meters, is lower than some neighboring giants, but the technical demands of Gamma 1 provide plenty of adventure.

Essential equipment includes a helmet, harness, and via ferrata lanyard, with safety being a priority on this exposed and occasionally technical route. Due to its location, itâ€™s advisable to check weather conditions before setting out, as rain or wet rocks can make the climb significantly more hazardous.

Whether you're an experienced climber or a newcomer seeking a new adventure, Via Ferrata Gamma 1 delivers a thrilling alpine experience that rewards climbers with stunning landscapes and a true sense of accomplishment.
